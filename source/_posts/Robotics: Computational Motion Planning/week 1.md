### A* Algorithm
### Quiz
1. If you use the Grassfire or breadth first search procedure to plan a path through a grid from a node A to a node B, then you use the same procedure to plan a path from node B to node A, will the two paths have the same length?\
**Yes**\
2.If you use the Grassfire or breadth first search procedure to plan a path through a grid from a node A to a node B, then you use the same procedure to plan a path from node B to node A, are the two paths guaranteed to be the same except in opposite directions?\
**No**\
3.If you use the grassfire algorithm to plan a path through a series of grids with increasing dimension, 2 dimensional, 3 dimensional, 4 dimensional etc. The amount of computational effort required increases
with the dimension of the problem.\
**exponentially**\
4.Generally speaking, which procedure would take less time to find a solution to a typical path planning problem on a discrete grid or graph?\
**A***
